# lenderassist

To install, download the .zip file or pull to a directory. In Chrome, go to the Extensions page and check "Developer mode".
Then click "Load unpacked extension" and select the directory.

## Lender/Team Pages

1.    When hovering over any link anywhere on the site that goes to a lender or team page, the extension will pull information on that lender/team
and then speak some basic details.
2.    When visiting a lender's page, instead of showing the old graphs, there are "Super Graphs" that display which allow for much more
control over what you're seeing.

## Kiva Live

1.    Adds a "Live" link to the top of every page that will take you to the Kiva Live page which allows you to view an animated map or globe
and have a live feed of activity on the site, including new lenders joining, new loans posting, lenders joining teams, and of course when a lender
lends to a borrower.
2.    The extension will look up and speak details about each ticker item as long as there is time to do so. For example, when a lender joins a team,
in addition to reading that ticker entry, given time (slow site activity), it will look up details on the team and tell you how long they've been around
and how many members and loans they have. When a lender makes a loan, given time, it will look up how many loans they've made total, how long they've been
on Kiva and what their top lending sectors are.

## Kiva Zip

1.    The "Zip" link along the top of the site will automatically change where it points based on things you've done. If you've ever logged into Zip,
it knows you already have an account. If you're already logged in on Kiva but not on Zip, the Zip link will auto-log you in. If you're already logged in
on Zip, the link will just take you to the listing of fundraising loans.

## Chrome Omnibar

1.    In Chrome's URL/Search bar, just type "kiva cattle" and the extension will automatically send that query to Kiva's lend tab.
2.    If you type "kiva" it will also display some popular kiva pages that you can immediately jump to.

## Loan Pages

1.    When viewing a fundraising loan, the Lender Assistant will make comments on things that are out of the ordinary with the loan. This includes
a longer or shorter than normal repayment term, when the rating of the partner is much higher or lower than normal.
2.    Once the Lender Assistant knows who you are (you just have to log in once, it'll figure out the rest), it will be able to relate the loan you're
looking at to loans in your portfolio and, for example, comment that you've made a lot of loans to that country before but they're all done paying back.
