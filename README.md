## Custom Banner Buttons
*  Add your own buttons to your favorite pages to Kiva's Banner!
*  Select from one of the presets
*  Or add up to 3 of your own custom buttons (Can link to any page, on Kiva or anywhere)

## Lend Tab
* Adds the Partner Name
* Adds the Final Repayment date to the Loan Cards along with the repayment interval (Monthly, End of term or Irregular)
* Adds Sparklines (tiny bar graphs) of repayment amounts. Get a quick overview of what the repayments will look like, one big repayment at the end of 4 years? Evenly distributed?

## Loan Pages
*  Adds Posted Date and Expiration Date (presented in your timezone)
*  Adds Repayment Graphs to visualize how the repayments are scheduled, along with the dates that 50%, 75% and 100% is paid back.
*  Has an option to always display the Partner/Trustee information (by default, it's collapsed)
*  When viewing a fundraising loan, the Lender Assistant will make comments on things that are out of the ordinary with the loan. This includes
a longer or shorter than normal repayment term, when the rating of the partner is much higher or lower than normal, etc.
*  Once the Lender Assistant knows who you are (you just have to log in once, it'll figure out the rest), it will be able to relate the loan you're
looking at to loans in your portfolio and, for example, comment that you've made a lot of loans to that country before but they're all done paying back.

## Lender/Team Pages
* When hovering over any link anywhere on the site that goes to a lender or team page, the extension will pull information on that lender/team
and then speak some basic details.
* When visiting a lender's page, instead of showing the old graphs, there are "Super Graphs" that display which allow for much more
control over what you're seeing.
* On a Lender Page, it adds a link to view that user's portfolio on a "3D wall"

## Kiva Live/Happening Now
*  One of the Custom Button presets allows you to jump you to the "Happening Now" page which allows you to view an animated map or globe
and have a live feed of activity on the site, including new lenders joining, new loans posting, lenders joining teams, and of course when a lender
lends to a borrower.
*  The extension will look up and speak details about each ticker item as long as there is time to do so. For example, when a lender joins a team,
in addition to reading that ticker entry, given time (slow site activity), it will look up details on the team and tell you how long they've been around
and how many members and loans they have. When a lender makes a loan, given time, it will look up how many loans they've made total, how long they've been
on Kiva and what their top lending sectors are.

## Chrome Omnibar
*  In Chrome's URL/Search bar, just type "kiva cattle" and the extension will automatically send a query for "cattle" to Kiva's lend tab.
*  If you type "kiva" and start typing another word it will also display some popular Kiva pages that you can immediately jump to.
